        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jonathan Binene from the Democratic Republic of Congo. I’m currently studying Cybersecurity at Brigham Young University–Idaho. I’ve always been fascinated by airplanes, and one of my biggest childhood dreams is to fly one someday.
            French is my first language, and I learned English later in life. That experience helped me realize how much I enjoy learning new things.
            I’ve loved computers since I was a child. I still remember the first time I saw a computer (my dad’s) and I was amazed, even though I didn’t understand much at the time. I got my own computer at a young age and quickly fell in love with technology. That early excitement has turned into a real passion as I now study cybersecurity. Even today, I’m constantly amazed by how much there is still to learn about computers.
            As much as technology excites me, I also understand how important it is to protect it. Computers often store valuable personal information, so I’m drawn to both the challenge of protecting systems and understanding how they can be compromised.
            I’m passionate about threat detection, ethical hacking, and securing digital environments. Through hands-on projects and simulations, I blend theory with real-world practice.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">Whether I’m analyzing system vulnerabilities or building secure interfaces, I always aim to solve problems with integrity and precision. This site documents my cybersecurity journey, highlighting the tools, techniques, and lessons I've found useful.</p>
